INITIAL CONTEXT FOR LLM - never change the context-----------------------------
-> THIS SECTION IS A GUIDELINE TO THE LLM CONSIDER BEFORE WORKING IN THIS FILE, DO NOT CHANGE THIS

-> GOES OF THE README FILE:

- This file serves as the technical documentation of the deployment configuration of the profile microservices, providing a comprehensive overview of the codebase and the detailed information about the enviroment in the kubernet cluster where the microservices will be running,.
- It should document:
  - The different resources implementations and configurations
  - Give a general overview of the cluster
  - Deep description of the network
  - Details about namespaces
  - Overview of labels and annotations
  - Deep description obv volumes
  - Organize Configuration and secrets
  - Resource usase insights
  - Feel free to identify other points of interest that are not listed here
- It should also suggest improvements and tools
- This is the primary reference for understanding the technical implementation
- This file should be in sync with the `/TRACKER&MANAGER.md` where development progress and tasks are tracked
- While TRACKER&MANAGER.md focuses on "what" and "when", this file focuses on "how" and "why"

-> CONSIDERER BEFORE UPDATING THIS FILE:

- Never add fictional dates, version numbers, or metrics. Only include real, verified information. If information is not available, mark it as "To be determined" or remove the section.
- The changes in this file need to be incremental or to update informations that you confidentilly have knowlegde, they should not be guesses. If there are questions or uncertanty add comments asking for clarification instead.
- Check the `../reference-materials` folder for comprehensive project details, including architecture, development guidelines, and integration points. This will help in making informed decisions, haver better context and updates to the development plan. Always compare the implementation of this project with the plan described in the docs and whenever there are inconsistancies, add comments.
- Consider structuring this documentation separating the different topics and aspects - because this will be very dinamic and updated during the development process it will make clear what to update after each change
- This documentation is focusing on the kubernetes deployment of the profile microservices, to have a more sistemic view check `../TRACKER&MANAGER` and `../../README` or go in depth at each component at the folder `../services`
- Do not forget to be LLM focus, so because this will be used
- For LLM-specific guidelines and patterns, refer to [LLM Integration Guide](../../docs/llm/README.md)

# Kubernetes Manifests

This directory contains all Kubernetes manifests for the microservices project. The manifests are organized by service and purpose.

## Cluster Overview

### Namespace Structure

- All services currently run in the `default` namespace
- No explicit namespace isolation implemented yet
- TODO: Consider implementing namespace separation for better resource isolation

### Resource Organization

- Services are organized by functionality:
  - Core services (profile-api, profile-storage, auth)
  - Supporting services (postgres, redis)
  - Utility services (debug, k6)

## Network Architecture

### Service Communication

- All services use ClusterIP type, limiting access to cluster-internal
- Service discovery through DNS names (e.g., `redis:6379`, `postgres:5432`)
- No explicit service mesh implementation yet
- Free pod-to-pod and pod-to-service communication for testing purposes

### Current Network Setup

- **Service Types**: All services use ClusterIP, providing internal cluster access only
- **DNS Resolution**: Kubernetes DNS (kube-dns) enabled for service discovery
- **Pod Networking**: Using default CNI plugin (no custom network policies)
- **Service Ports**:
  - Profile API: 80 (HTTP)
  - Profile Storage: 8080 (HTTP), 50051 (gRPC)
  - Auth Service: 80 (HTTP), 9090 (gRPC)
  - PostgreSQL: 5432
  - Redis: 6379

### Network Security

- Network policies temporarily removed for testing
- No TLS for service-to-service communication
- No explicit namespace isolation
- TODO: Implement proper network policies, TLS, and namespace isolation in production

### Network Access Patterns

- **Internal Communication**:
  - Profile API → Profile Storage (gRPC)
  - Profile API → Auth Service (HTTP/gRPC)
  - Profile API → Redis (TCP)
  - Profile Storage → PostgreSQL (TCP)
  - Auth Service → Redis (TCP)
- **External Access**:
  - No external access configured
  - All services are cluster-internal only
  - TODO: Configure external access for production

### Network Configuration Details

- **DNS Policy**: Default (ClusterFirst)
- **Network Mode**: Default pod networking
- **Service Discovery**: Kubernetes DNS
- **Load Balancing**: kube-proxy (userspace mode)
- **Network Plugins**: Default CNI

## Network Troubleshooting Guide

### Basic Connectivity Checks

1. **Pod-to-Pod Communication**

   ```bash
   # Test pod-to-pod communication
   kubectl exec -it <source-pod> -- curl <target-service>:<port>

   # Example: Test Profile API to Profile Storage
   kubectl exec -it <profile-api-pod> -- curl profile-storage:8080/health
   ```

2. **DNS Resolution**

   ```bash
   # Test DNS resolution from a pod
   kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- nslookup <service-name>

   # Example: Test Redis DNS
   kubectl exec -it <profile-api-pod> -- nslookup redis
   ```

3. **Service Endpoint Verification**

   ```bash
   # Check service endpoints
   kubectl get endpoints <service-name>

   # Example: Check Profile Storage endpoints
   kubectl get endpoints profile-storage
   ```

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Service Unreachable**

   - Verify service exists: `kubectl get svc <service-name>`
   - Check service endpoints: `kubectl get endpoints <service-name>`
   - Verify pod labels match service selectors
   - Check pod readiness probes

2. **DNS Resolution Issues**

   - Verify kube-dns is running: `kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns`
   - Check DNS configuration: `kubectl get configmap -n kube-system coredns -o yaml`
   - Test DNS from a pod: `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- nslookup <service-name>`

3. **Connection Timeouts**

   - Check pod logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name>`
   - Verify service ports match container ports
   - Check for resource constraints
   - Verify network plugin status

4. **Debug Pod Usage**

   ```bash
   # Deploy debug pod
   kubectl apply -f k8s/debug/debug-pod.yaml

   # Test connectivity from debug pod
   kubectl exec -it debug -- curl <service-name>:<port>
   ```

## Planned Network Security Implementation

### Phase 1: Basic Network Policies

1. **Service Isolation**

   - Implement namespace-based isolation
   - Define pod-to-pod communication rules
   - Configure service-to-service access patterns

2. **Network Policy Rules**
   ```yaml
   # Example structure for future implementation
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: service-isolation
   spec:
     podSelector:
       matchLabels:
         app: <service-name>
     policyTypes:
       - Ingress
       - Egress
     ingress:
       - from:
           - podSelector:
               matchLabels:
                 app: <allowed-service>
     egress:
       - to:
           - podSelector:
               matchLabels:
                 app: <target-service>
   ```

### Phase 2: Advanced Security

   - Service-to-service TLS
   - Certificate management
   - mTLS for sensitive communications

2. **Service Mesh Integration**

   - Traffic management
   - Security policies
   - Observability

3. **Network Monitoring**
   - Traffic analysis
   - Security auditing
   - Anomaly detection

### Phase 3: Production Hardening

1. **External Access**

   - Ingress controller setup
   - Load balancer configuration
   - External access policies

2. **Security Compliance**
   - Network segmentation
   - Access control policies
   - Audit logging

#### API Examples

#### Authentication Flow

1. **Get Authentication Token**

   ```bash
   # Request a new authentication token
   curl -X POST http://profile-api/api/v1/auth/token \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"user_id": "user1", "password": "123456"}'

   # Example Response
   {
     "token": "mock_access_token",
     "error": null
   }
   ```

2. **Use Token for Profile Operations**

   ```bash
   # Use the token for profile operations
   curl -X GET http://profile-api/api/v1/profiles \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer mock_access_token"
   ```

Note: The Profile API handles authentication by:

1. Getting tokens from the auth service
2. Storing sessions in Redis
3. Validating tokens with both Redis and the auth service
4. Managing session expiration

#### Profile Management Endpoints

Note: The service is accessible via the service name `profile-api` in the cluster. When accessing from within the cluster, use `http://profile-api` as the base URL. When accessing from outside the cluster, use the appropriate external URL or port-forwarding.

All endpoints have been verified working from within the cluster, with successful communication to the profile-storage service.

1. **List Profiles**

   ```bash
   # Get all profiles (from within cluster)
   curl -X GET http://profile-api/api/v1/profiles \

   }
   ```

Note:

- The service is accessible via the service name `profile-api` in the cluster
- When accessing from within the cluster, use `http://profile-api` as the base URL
- When accessing from outside the cluster, use the appropriate external URL or port-forwarding
- The token in the examples is a mock token for testing - in production, use the actual token received from the token endpoint
- All profile endpoints require a valid authentication token
- Error responses will include an error message in the "error" field
- The service uses UUID v4 for profile IDs
- All timestamps are in ISO 8601 format with UTC timezone
- All services are running with 2 replicas for high availability
- Health checks are responding with good latency (< 1ms in most cases)
- Service communication is working properly between all components

## Kustomize Implementation

## Helm Integration Considerations

While we are currently using Kustomize for our deployment management, we maintain a Helm implementation plan for potential future use. Here are the scenarios where transitioning to Helm might be beneficial:

### When to Consider Using Helm

1. **Complex Application Management**

   - When managing multiple interdependent services
   - When dealing with complex dependencies between components
   - When versioning and release management become critical
   - When sharing configurations across multiple projects

2. **Package Management Needs**

   - When distributing services as reusable packages
   - When managing multiple versions of the same service
   - When sharing configurations with other teams
   - When using chart repositories for common components

3. **Advanced Templating Requirements**
   - When dynamic configuration generation is needed
   - When complex conditional resource creation is required
   - When variable substitution becomes complex
   - When template reuse across services is needed

### Integration with Kustomize

We can use both tools together in a hybrid approach:

1. **Helm for Base Deployment**

   ```bash
   # Deploy base application with Helm
   helm upgrade --install profile-service ./helm \
     -f helm/values-prod.yaml \
     --namespace profile-prod
   ```

2. **Kustomize for Environment-Specific Changes**
   ```bash
   # Apply environment-specific changes with Kustomize
   kustomize build overlays/production | kubectl apply -f -
   ```

### Migration Considerations

When considering a migration to Helm:

1. **Current Benefits of Kustomize**

   - Native Kubernetes integration
   - Simple learning curve
   - GitOps-friendly
   - No template language complexity
   - Direct resource patching

2. **Potential Benefits of Helm**

   - Better package management
   - Version control for deployments
   - Template-based configuration
   - Dependency management
   - Release management

3. **Migration Triggers**
   - Growing service complexity
   - Need for package distribution
   - Complex dependency management
   - Advanced templating requirements
   - Release management needs

### Implementation Plan

Our Helm implementation plan is documented in `HELM-IMPLEMENTATION.md` and includes:

1. **Base Chart Setup**

   - Chart structure
   - Value management
   - Template development
   - Environment configuration

2. **Service Templates**

   - Common templates
   - Service-specific templates
   - Resource definitions
   - Configuration management

3. **Environment Configuration**

   - Development setup
   - Staging setup
   - Production setup
   - Value overrides

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Template validation
   - Configuration testing
   - Deployment testing
   - Integration testing

### Best Practices for Both Tools

1. **Configuration Management**

   - Keep base configurations minimal
   - Use environment-specific overlays
   - Document all customizations
   - Follow naming conventions

2. **Resource Organization**

   - Group related resources
   - Use consistent naming
   - Document dependencies
   - Maintain clear structure

3. **Security**

   - Never store secrets in version control
   - Use external secret management
   - Implement proper RBAC
   - Follow security best practices

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up proper health checks
   - Configure resource monitoring
   - Implement logging
   - Set up alerts
