INITIAL CONTEXT FOR LLM - never change the context-----------------------------
-> THIS SECTION IS A GUIDELINE TO THE LLM CONSIDER BEFORE WORKING IN THIS FILE, DO NOT CHANGE THIS

-> GOES OF THE TRACKER&MANAGER FILE:

- This is a high level documentation file, many of the subfolders have their all documentations files, so you should keep track of all the documentation under you.
- This file serves as the development progress tracker and project management tool
- It should track:
  - Development phases and milestones
  - Task status and progress
  - Dependencies and blockers
  - Technical decisions and their rationale
  - Questions and clarifications needed
- This is the primary reference for understanding the development progress
- This file should be in sync with the `/README.md` where technical implementation details are documented
- While README.md focuses on "how" and "why", this file focuses on "what" and "when"

-> CONSIDERER BEFORE UPDATING THIS FILE:

- Never add fictional dates, version numbers, or metrics. Only include real, verified information. If information is not available, mark it as "To be determined".
- The changes in this file need to be incremental, so update tasks as they are completed, reorganize them or add new tasks but do not remove any of the previous one. If something needs to be removed, add a note instead.
- Update informations that you confidentilly have knowlegde, they should not be guesses.
- If there are questions or uncertanty add comments asking for clarification instead.
- Check the `microservices/docs` folder for comprehensive project details, including architecture, development guidelines, and integration points. This will help in making informed decisions, haver better context and updates to the development plan. Always compare the implementation of this project with the plan described in the docs and whenever there are inconsistancies, add comments.
- Create and maintain the Development Phases section with different phases that should be accomplished as a path to the final project. This section should have an introduction describing what would be a possible final state of the whole project. The next sessions will be phases, like alpha, sigma, etc where there are a description of what each service should have develop, and what success would be so the phase will be checked as completed. The step-by-step test plan for each phase should be writen before executing it.
- Always be in sync and coordinate the pace of the sub-projects that are in the sub-folders.
- Do not forget to be LLM focus, so because this will be used.
- For LLM-specific guidelines and patterns, refer to [LLM Integration Guide](../../docs/llm/README.md)
