INITIAL CONTEXT FOR LLM - never change the context-----------------------------
-> THIS SECTION IS A GUIDELINE TO THE LLM CONSIDER BEFORE WORKING IN THIS FILE, DO NOT CHANGE THIS

-> GOES OF THE README FILE:

- This file serves as the technical documentation of the service, providing a comprehensive overview of the codebase
- It should document:
  - Service architecture and design decisions
  - Component structure and relationships
  - API endpoints and interfaces
  - Dependencies and integration points
  - Configuration and deployment details
- This is the primary reference for understanding the technical implementation
- This file should be in sync with the `/TRACKER&MANAGER.md` where development progress and tasks are tracked
- While TRACKER&MANAGER.md focuses on "what" and "when", this file focuses on "how" and "why"

-> CONSIDERER BEFORE UPDATING THIS FILE:

- Never add fictional dates, version numbers, or metrics. Only include real, verified information. If information is not available, mark it as "To be determined" or remove the section.
- The changes in this file need to be incremental or to update informations that you confidentilly have knowlegde, they should not be guesses. If there are questions or uncertanty add comments asking for clarification instead.
- Check the `../../microservices/docs` folder for comprehensive project details, including architecture, development guidelines, and integration points. This will help in making informed decisions, haver better context and updates to the development plan. Always compare the implementation of this project with the plan described in the docs and whenever there are inconsistancies, add comments.
- Consider structuring this documentation separating the components and describing each one of them and adding sections to how they interact with each other - because this will be very dinamic and updated during the development process it will make clear what to update after each change
- This documentation is focusing in the current component that is part of a larger project, to have a more sistemic view check `../../microservices/TRACKER&MANAGER` and `../../microservices/README`
- Do not forget to be LLM focus, so because this will be used
- For LLM-specific guidelines and patterns, refer to [LLM Integration Guide](../../docs/llm/README.md)

curl -X POST profile-auth/v1/oauth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "grant_type": "authorization_code",
    "code": "mock_authorization_code"
  }'

# OAuth user info
curl -X GET profile-auth/v1/oauth/userinfo \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mock_oauth_access_token"
```

### RBAC Endpoints

```bash
# Get roles
curl -X GET profile-auth/v1/rbac/roles \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mock_access_token"

# Get permissions
curl -X GET profile-auth/v1/rbac/permissions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mock_access_token"
```

## Response Format

All endpoints return responses in the following format:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Operation successful",
  "data": {
    // Response data specific to the endpoint
  }
}
```

## Error Responses

All endpoints may return the following error responses:

```json
// 400 Bad Request
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Invalid request body"
}

// 401 Unauthorized
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Invalid or expired token"
}

// 403 Forbidden
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Insufficient permissions"
}

// 404 Not Found
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Resource not found"
}

// 500 Internal Server Error
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "An unexpected error occurred"
}
```

## Development

### Local Development

1. Start the service:

```bash
make run
```

2. Run tests:

```bash
make test
```

3. Build the service:

```bash
make build
```

### Environment Variables

The service can be configured using the following environment variables:

```bash
# Service Configuration
SERVICE_NAME=profile-auth
SERVICE_PORT=8080
METRICS_PORT=9090

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
JWT_EXPIRATION=24h
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION=168h

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=100
RATE_LIMIT_DURATION=1m

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info
LOG_FORMAT=json

# Environment
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

## Security Considerations

1. All passwords are hashed using bcrypt
2. JWT tokens are signed with a secure secret
3. Rate limiting is implemented to prevent brute force attacks
4. HTTPS is required in production
5. CORS is configured to allow only trusted origins
6. Input validation is performed on all endpoints
7. Sensitive data is never logged

## Best Practices

1. Always use HTTPS in production
2. Store tokens securely (HttpOnly cookies or secure storage)
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Use appropriate HTTP status codes
5. Follow RESTful conventions
6. Implement proper logging
7. Monitor rate limits and errors
