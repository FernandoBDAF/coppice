  name: profile-storage-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: profile-storage
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: microservice
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 50051 # gRPC port
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 8080 # REST API port
  egress:
    - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 192.168.86.115/32 # External PostgreSQL database
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 5432
```

4. Add performance tests
5. Implement caching strategy
6. Add rate limiting
7. Implement circuit breakers
8. Add comprehensive logging

# Database Schema Initialization

## Required Step: Initialize the Database Schema

The Profile Storage Service requires the PostgreSQL database schema (tables) to exist before it can start successfully. If the tables are missing, the service will fail to start and enter a CrashLoopBackOff state in Kubernetes.

### Manual Migration (Development/Testing)

If you are running the service in a fresh environment, you must manually create the tables using the provided migration SQL file:

```sh
PGPASSWORD=profile_password psql -h <DB_HOST> -U profile_user -d profiles -f internal/database/migrations/000001_init_schema.up.sql
```

Replace `<DB_HOST>` with your database host (e.g., `localhost` or your host IP).

#### Example (from host):

```sh
PGPASSWORD=profile_password psql -h 192.168.86.115 -U profile_user -d profiles -f internal/database/migrations/000001_init_schema.up.sql
```

### Troubleshooting

- If the service is stuck in CrashLoopBackOff, check the pod logs for database errors.
- Verify the database is running and accessible.
- Check if the required tables exist:
  ```sh
  PGPASSWORD=profile_password psql -h <DB_HOST> -U profile_user -d profiles -c "\\dt"
  ```
- If no tables are found, run the migration as shown above.

# Long-Term Solution: Automating Migrations

For production and CI/CD environments, schema migrations should be automated to ensure the service always has the required database structure. Here are recommended approaches:

## 1. Service-Managed Migrations

- Integrate a migration tool (e.g., [golang-migrate/migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate), [pressly/goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose)) into the service startup.
- The service runs migrations automatically before starting the main application logic.

## 2. Kubernetes Init Container

- Add an init container to the deployment that runs migrations before the main container starts.
- Ensures migrations are applied before the service attempts to connect.

## 3. Dedicated Migration Job

- Use a Kubernetes Job or a CI/CD pipeline step to run migrations before deploying the service.
- Ensures migrations are applied in a controlled, auditable way.

## 4. Helm Chart Hooks

- If using Helm, add a pre-install or pre-upgrade hook to run migrations.

**Recommendation:**

- For development, manual migration is acceptable.
- For production, use one of the automated approaches above to avoid startup failures and manual intervention.

## Logging System

### Overview

The Profile Storage Service implements a structured logging system using the `zap` logging library. The system is designed to provide consistent, structured logging across all components of the service, with different configurations for development and production environments.

### Current Implementation

The logging system has been implemented with the following features:

1. **Core Logger**

   - Singleton logger instance with thread-safe initialization
   - Environment-aware configuration (development/production)
   - Structured logging with JSON (production) and console (development) formats
   - Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL
   - Built-in stack traces for error logs
   - Contextual logging with fields
   - Helper functions for common field types

2. **Integration Points**

   - Database operations logging
   - Service layer logging
   - REST API handlers logging
   - gRPC handlers logging
   - Middleware logging
     - HTTP request/response logging
     - gRPC request/response logging
     - Panic recovery logging
     - Request timing tracking
     - Request ID tracking
     - Request timeout handling

3. **Log Rotation and Retention**
   - File-based logging with rotation
   - Size-based rotation (100MB)
   - Age-based retention (30 days)
   - Backup file management (5 backups)
   - Compression support

### Configuration

The logging system is configured through environment variables:

#### Basic Configuration

- `LOG_ENVIRONMENT`: Set to "development" or "production" (default: "development")
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Set to "debug", "info", "warn", "error" (default: "info")
- `SERVICE_NAME`: Name of the service for log identification (default: "profile-storage")

#### Log Rotation

- `LOG_MAX_SIZE`: Maximum size of log file in MB (default: 100)
- `LOG_MAX_BACKUPS`: Maximum number of backup files (default: 5)
- `LOG_MAX_AGE`: Maximum age of log files in days (default: 30)
- `LOG_COMPRESS`: Enable log compression (default: true)
- `LOG_DIR`: Directory for log files (default: "logs")

### Dependencies

- `go.uber.org/zap`: Core logging library
- `go.uber.org/multierr`: Error handling utilities
- `gopkg.in/natefinch/lumberjack.v2`: Log rotation

### Best Practices

1. **Context and Fields**

   - Always include relevant context in log messages
   - Use structured fields instead of string concatenation
   - Include request context in all logs
   - Use child loggers for request-scoped logging

2. **Error Handling**

   - Include error details when logging errors
   - Use proper error wrapping and context preservation
   - Log stack traces for unexpected errors
   - Use custom error types for specific scenarios

3. **Performance**

   - Use appropriate log levels
   - Track performance metrics in logs
   - Use batch processing for log aggregation
   - Implement proper retry mechanisms

4. **Security**

   - Keep sensitive information out of logs
   - Implement proper log rotation
   - Use secure log shipping
   - Monitor log access

5. **Maintenance**
   - Maintain consistent logging patterns
   - Document logging configuration
   - Monitor log storage usage
   - Regular log cleanup

### Future Improvements

1. **Log Management**

   - Implement log backup strategies
   - Add log archival capabilities
   - Enhance compression options
   - Add log validation

2. **Log Aggregation**

   - Implement log shipping to Elasticsearch
