## Best Practices for Working with Cursor

### 1. Context-First Requests

Always start your requests with context from our documentation files:

```markdown
"Please implement [task] as defined in [file] section [section]"
```

Example:

```
"Please implement the error handling package as defined in TRACKER.MD under Common Package Development"
```

### 2. Multi-Reference Requests

When implementing features, reference multiple files for complete context:

```markdown
"Please implement [feature] following:

- Architecture from README.md section [section]
- Patterns from MANAGER.md section [section]
- Interfaces from INTERFACE.MD section [section]"
```

Example:

```
"Please implement the profile service following:
- Clean architecture from README.md Implementation Standards
- Error handling from MANAGER.md Implementation Patterns
- REST API standards from INTERFACE.MD"
```

### 3. Update Requests

When asking for documentation updates, be specific about the changes:

```markdown
"Please update [file] to reflect:

- [change] in [section]
- [new information] in [section]"
```

Example:

```
"Please update TRACKER.MD to reflect:
- Completion of error handling package in Common Package Development
- New dependency on metrics package in Integration Tasks"
```

### 4. Verification Requests

Ask Cursor to verify implementations against documentation:

```markdown
"Please verify [implementation] against:

- Standards in [file]
- Patterns in [file]
- Requirements in [file]"
```

Example:

```
"Please verify the new profile service against:
- Clean architecture standards in README.md
- Error handling patterns in MANAGER.md
- Interface requirements in INTERFACE.MD"
```

## Quick Reference Guide for Updating Files

### TRACKER.MD Updates

1. **Status Updates**:

   ```markdown

   | ------ | ---------- | -------- | ------------ | -------------- |
   | [Task] | [Priority] | [Effort] | [New Status] | [Dependencies] |
   ```

2. **Add Notes**:

   ```markdown
   ## Notes

   - [Date] [Task]: [Update details]
   - [Date] [Task]: [Blocker details]
   ```

### INTERFACE.MD Updates

1. **Add New Interface**:

   ```markdown
   | Endpoint   | Method   | Purpose   | Authentication |
   | ---------- | -------- | --------- | -------------- |
   | [Endpoint] | [Method] | [Purpose] | [Auth]         |
   ```

2. **Update Standards**:
   ```markdown
   | Standard   | Description   | Implementation   |
   | ---------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
   | [Standard] | [Description] | [Implementation] |
   ```

### MANAGER.md Updates

1. **Add New Decision**:
   ```markdown

   | Decision        | [Final Decision] |
   | Rationale       | [Rationale]      |
   | Impact          | [Impact]         |
   ```

### README.md Updates

1. **Add New Section**:

   ```markdown
   ### [Section Name]

   [Content following existing format]
   ```

2. **Update Standards**:

   ```markdown
   #### [Standard Name]

   [Content following existing format]
   ```

3. Update dependencies if needed
```

## Using LLM.md for Prompt Generation

### Purpose

The LLM.md file serves as a template generator for creating structured prompts for Cursor. It helps ensure consistent, well-structured requests that leverage our documentation effectively.

### How to Use LLM.md

1. **Basic Usage**

   ```
   Please use the template from services/LLM.md to create a prompt for implementing "[TASK_NAME]" as defined in [FILE].md. I will use this prompt in a new chat.
   ```

2. **Example Request**

   ```
   Please use the template from services/LLM.md to create a prompt for implementing "Rename all service folders to follow pattern" as defined in TRACKER.MD. I will use this prompt in a new chat.
   ```

3. **Using the Generated Prompt**
   - Review the generated prompt
   - Copy it
   - Start a new chat
   - Paste the prompt with a simple introduction:
   ```
   Please help me implement this task. Here's my structured request:
   [paste the generated prompt]
   ```

### Tips for Effective Prompt Generation

1. **Be Specific**

   - Use exact task names
   - Reference specific files
   - Include section references

2. **Provide Context**

   - Mention related tasks
   - Include dependencies
   - Reference patterns

3. **Review Generated Prompt**

   - Check completeness
   - Verify references
   - Ensure clarity

4. **Maintain Documentation**
   - Update task status
   - Document changes
   - Track progress
