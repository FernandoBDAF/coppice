INITIAL CONTEXT FOR LLM - never change the context-----------------------------
-> THIS SECTION IS A GUIDELINE TO THE LLM CONSIDER BEFORE WORKING IN THIS FILE, DO NOT CHANGE THIS

-> GOES OF THE README FILE:

- This is a high level documentation file, many of the subfolders have their all documentations files, so you should keep track of all the documentation under you.
- This file serves as the technical documentation of the service, providing a comprehensive overview of the codebase
- It should document:
  - Service architecture and design decisions focusing in the cross interaction between services having a more sistemic view
  - Component structure and relationships
  - Dependencies and integration points
  - Configuration and deployment details
- This is the primary reference for understanding the technical implementation
- This file should be in sync with the `/TRACKER&MANAGER.md` where development progress and tasks are tracked
- While TRACKER&MANAGER.md focuses on "what" and "when", this file focuses on "how" and "why"

-> CONSIDERER BEFORE UPDATING THIS FILE:

- Never add fictional dates, version numbers, or metrics. Only include real, verified information. If information is not available, mark it as "To be determined" or remove the section.
- The changes in this file need to be incremental or to update informations that you confidentilly have knowlegde, they should not be guesses. If there are questions or uncertanty add comments asking for clarification instead.
- Check the `microservices/docs` folder for comprehensive project details, including architecture, development guidelines, and integration points. This will help in making informed decisions, haver better context and updates to the development plan. Always compare the implementation of this project with the plan described in the docs and whenever there are inconsistancies, add comments.
- Consider structuring this documentation separating the services and referencing their documentation yet summarizing them. Else add sections to organize different aspects of the cross interaction, dependencies and decisions. Because this will be very dinamic and updated during the development process it will make clear what to update after each change
- Do not forget to be LLM focus, so because this will be used
- For LLM-specific guidelines and patterns, refer to [LLM Integration Guide](../../docs/llm/README.md)

## Service Interactions

### Communication Patterns

1. **Synchronous Communication**

   - REST APIs for external clients
   - gRPC for internal service communication
   - Health check endpoints
   - Service-to-service communication verified
   - Response times < 1ms for health checks
   - Proper error handling implemented

2. **Asynchronous Communication**
   - Message queues for event handling (planned)
   - Event-driven patterns (planned)
   - Background job processing (planned)

### Data Flow

1. **Profile Management Flow**

   ```
   Client → Profile API → Auth Service
                    ↓
              Profile Storage
                    ↓
              PostgreSQL
   ```

2. **Authentication Flow**

   ```
   Client → Auth Service → Get Token
                    ↓
              Profile API
                    ↓
              Redis (Session Management)
                    ↓
              Token Validation (Auth Service)
   ```

   Key points:

   - Authentication is handled by the Auth Service
   - Profile API uses Redis for session management
   - Token validation is delegated to Auth Service
   - No direct JWT handling in Profile API
   - Mock token system working for testing
   - UUID v4 format for profile IDs
   - ISO 8601 timestamp format for dates

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
